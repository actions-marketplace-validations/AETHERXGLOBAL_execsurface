# ExecSurface — Current Status

Date: 2026-10-03

This file states the current public product state. Historical milestone, prerelease and engagement documents are evidence records and may describe the release that was current when they closed.

## Current public product state

**ExecSurface v0.1.0-alpha.5 is the Final Supported Alpha Release for Linux x86_64 within the documented native-ptrace product boundary.**

Current bounded state:

`ALPHA5_FINAL_SUPPORTED_ALPHA_WITH_DECLARED_LIMITATIONS — LINUX_X86_64_PTRACE`

- Public release: `v0.1.0-alpha.5`
- Release source commit: `9e73b925d55557e33de1b0813995609aaefdc037`
- Frozen product source used for Alpha.5 qualification: `5067200452c174da6bc8d9d7ecf6957ee379f0a2`
- Stable GitHub Action: `AETHERXGLOBAL/execsurface@v0.1`
- Stable `v0.1` resolves to the Alpha.5 release source commit above.
- Immutable Action pin: `AETHERXGLOBAL/execsurface@v0.1.0-alpha.5`
- Registry package: `execsurface = 0.1.0-alpha.5`
- Supported public product scope: Linux x86_64
- Public default/reference observer: native `ptrace`
- ExecSurface verdict / exit-code contract: PASS `0`, ERROR `2`, REVIEW `10`, BLOCK `20`

`main` may advance with documentation, evaluation or maintenance commits after the immutable release source. Consumers that require immutable review should pin `v0.1.0-alpha.5`.

## Final Alpha.5 qualification

The supported-product closeout was executed against the already-published Alpha.5 artifact and immutable Alpha.5 source rather than a replacement build.

Authoritative qualification evidence:

- qualification PR run `37144655462`: SUCCESS;
- post-merge `main` qualification run `37144894250`: SUCCESS;
- post-merge Public Consumer Smoke run `37144894395`: SUCCESS;
- post-merge normal CI run `37144894249`: SUCCESS.

The qualification covered:

- exact published artifact on Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04;
- checksum and GitHub attestation verification plus archive-safety checks;
- Debian 12 and Fedora 42 userland portability under explicit ptrace capability; these container results do **not** claim distinct-kernel coverage;
- 250 repeated unchanged PASS checks and 100 repeated controlled REVIEW checks with baseline byte immutability;
- malformed, missing and unsupported baseline/policy inputs with fail-closed behavior;
- external interruption of ExecSurface itself cannot complete as PASS;
- immutable Alpha.5-source replay of the 300-run PATH-TOCTOU adversarial suite plus shared-FD falsifier on Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04;
- ptrace regression and the full frozen workspace suite on both Ubuntu hosts;
- exact crates.io clean installation;
- stable `@v0.1` identity against the immutable Alpha.5 source;
- stable Action PASS outputs/evidence and ERROR fail-closed behavior.

This is bounded product qualification for the declared Linux x86_64/native-ptrace scope. It is not a claim of universal compatibility with every Linux distribution, kernel, container policy or host security configuration.

## Declared Alpha.5 limitation — target outcome is not verdict-bearing

Alpha.5 separates the target command's outcome from the ExecSurface drift verdict.

The wrapped target's exit code or terminating signal is recorded in the report, but **does not by itself change PASS / REVIEW / BLOCK in Alpha.5**. A target that exits nonzero or is signalled can therefore receive `ExecSurface: PASS` when no policy-relevant execution-surface finding exists.

Therefore:

- `ExecSurface: PASS` means the selected observation/comparison/policy found no review/block execution-surface drift;
- it does **not** mean the wrapped target command succeeded;
- CI users must preserve the target command's own success/failure gate when target correctness matters;
- the GitHub Action `exit-code` output is the ExecSurface verdict code, not the native target exit code.

This limitation was discovered during final qualification and is retained as issue `#143`. Alpha.5 semantics are not silently rewritten after publication; any future target-outcome enforcement change must be versioned and compatibility-reviewed.

## Distribution state

Alpha.5 completed the release and post-publication chain: deterministic dual build and compatibility checks; checksum and provenance generation; GitHub prerelease publication; public-artifact byte/source equivalence; clean binary consumption on Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04; immutable-tag installation and Action verdict checks; stable `v0.1` promotion only after public proofs; stable-channel public Action checks; registry publication; zero-contact registry install/smoke; and the later Final Alpha.5 qualification described above.

Canonical public-release workflow run: `36910725515`.

## Product boundary

ExecSurface is a **runtime behavioral-integrity and verification layer for observed execution-surface drift**.

It is not antivirus, EDR, SIEM, malware detection, a sandbox, a general mandatory-access-control system or proof that software is safe.

- Observed behavior is not all possible behavior.
- Incomplete or ambiguous observation evidence cannot silently become PASS.
- A baseline is not policy.
- Backend identity alone does not create semantic authority.
- Native ptrace remains the bounded public reference observer.
- Windows support is not claimed.
- ARM64 support is not claimed.
- BPF-LSM/kernel-hook work remains research/managed and non-default unless a later evidence gate explicitly changes that boundary.

## External validation state

Independent external validation remains open as additional evidence, not as a blocker to the bounded Final Supported Alpha state above.

This repository does **not** claim independent validation, endorsement, adoption or approval by external reviewers or organizations merely from internal qualification, downloads, stars, outreach or community participation.

Current external-evidence paths remain:

- evidence qualification/tracking: issue `#114`;
- public Alpha.5 review hub: issue `#118`;
- external real-workload production evidence: issue `#140`.

Any future external failure, counterexample, no-fit result or limitation remains valid evidence and may constrain later claims/releases.

## Historical evidence handling

Historical failures, prerelease decisions, closed-gate workflows and negative evidence are retained. Operationally obsolete files may be moved out of active paths into `docs/archive/` or `.github/workflow-archive/`; that is repository hygiene, not evidence deletion or history rewriting.

For current public facts, use this file, `README.md`, the latest GitHub Release and `docs/releases/v0.1.0-alpha.5.md`.
