# Roadmap

## M0 — Architecture Freeze

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

## M1 — Minimal Linux Observer

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Metadata-only native ptrace backend on Linux x86_64. CI proves descendant exec observation, argv non-capture sentinel, path-based file observation, loopback connect destination, strict Clippy, and locked dependency reproducibility.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M1_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M2 — Canonicalization

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Deterministic canonical surface across PID/sequence/interleaving and declared machine-root variance. Explicit semantic roots, credential-shadow protection, unresolved-path semantics, deterministic deduplication, open-intent preservation, and observer→canonical repeatability are covered by CI.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M2_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M3 — Baseline Lock

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

`execsurface learn -- COMMAND` creates a deterministic `execsurface.lock.json` with a frozen SHA-256 digest contract, privacy-safe command identity, explicit schema/versioning, atomic publication and no silent overwrite.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M3_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M4 — Diff Engine

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Verified baseline ingestion, comparability gating, deterministic added/removed findings, conservative changed pairing, JSON/text reporting, and real `learn → check` integration are covered by CI.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M4_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M5 — Policy / Verdict

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Independent policy v1 maps M4 findings to ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK using deterministic order-independent rule resolution. No drift is always PASS; operational/comparability failures remain ERROR.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M5_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M6 — GitHub Action

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Linux x86_64 composite Action with deterministic JSON evidence, Markdown job summary, artifact upload, PASS/REVIEW/BLOCK/ERROR enforcement, configurable REVIEW failure and privacy smoke evidence.

SARIF finding emission is **KILLED / DEFERRED for M6 v1** because current runtime evidence does not establish a causal repository source file/line. ExecSurface does not invent source locations for Code Scanning.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M6_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M6.5 — Semantic Fidelity & Completeness Hardening

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

Hardened Linux ptrace evidence with syscall entry/exit pairing, successful-open fd identity, fd-attributed read/write effects, close/dup/fork/CLONE_FILES handling, openat/openat2 semantics, bounded causal execution chains, explicit event-budget truncation, fault injection, v2 schema migration and reproducible performance evidence.

The controlled 128-file burst remained complete with a median absolute ptrace overhead of 51.569 ms on the final shared-runner measurement. This is below the pre-M7 500 ms absolute-overhead trigger. ptrace therefore remains the reference correctness backend for M7; eBPF is not authorized as an interchangeable backend without equivalent lost-event/completeness semantics.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M6_5_EVIDENCE.md`.
Backend decision: `docs/milestones/M6_5_BACKEND_DECISION.md`.

## M6.6 — Public Self-Service & Distribution Gate

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

ExecSurface is now distributed as a Linux x86_64 public alpha with a GitHub Release binary, SHA-256 checksum, build-provenance attestation, fresh Cargo Git fallback, `execsurface doctor`, conservative `execsurface init`, product-first documentation and a gated `@v0.1` GitHub Action channel.

The immutable `v0.1.0-alpha.1` release and moving `v0.1` Action channel both point to the release-gated source commit `d6919e2b3e23b196965bc7bba87598f09265599f`. The release workflow proved checksum/provenance verification, zero-contact binary use, fresh Cargo tag installation, immutable Action consumption, and stable-channel PASS/REVIEW/BLOCK/ERROR behavior.

M6.6 did not change v2 evidence semantics, verdict semantics, baseline/policy separation, the Linux x86_64 support boundary, or the M6.5 ptrace/eBPF decision.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M6_6_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M7 — External Real-World Proof

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED — COMPATIBILITY PROOF**

External target:

`sharkdp/fd@ce97e473ebaec49697c07daa50a7bc2b32f713d2`

The pinned upstream suite reproduced with 118 tests passing. ExecSurface public release `v0.1.0-alpha.1` learned a real `fd` runtime baseline with 517 canonical effects, produced repeated no-drift PASS results, and detected a controlled runtime expansion as REVIEW with an added `sha256sum` process execution plus fd-attributed read evidence for the fixture file.

The stable public Action channel `AETHERXGLOBAL/execsurface@v0.1` also proved PASS for the baseline command and REVIEW for the controlled expansion.

No upstream modification or maintainer contact occurred before the proof passed. This is compatibility evidence, **not third-party adoption**.

Evidence: `docs/milestones/M7_EVIDENCE.md`.

## M7.1 — Registry Distribution Parity

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED**

ExecSurface `0.1.0-alpha.2` is published on crates.io under the public package name `execsurface`, together with its publishable runtime workspace crates.

The publication chain was resumed safely after two preserved infrastructure failures:

- crates.io account email verification initially blocked the first upload;
- crates.io new-crate rate limits temporarily interrupted the multi-crate publication chain.

The idempotent recovery path skipped versions already present in the registry, completed all eight packages, and then proved a zero-contact fresh install directly from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install execsurface --version "=0.1.0-alpha.2" --locked
```

The installed binary passed `--version`, `doctor`, `learn`, and a no-drift `check` with PASS / 0 findings on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 runner.

The normal Rust-native user path is now:

```bash
cargo install execsurface --locked
```

GitHub Release binaries and the stable `AETHERXGLOBAL/execsurface@v0.1` Action channel remain supported. No observer, evidence-schema, canonicalization, baseline, policy, or verdict semantics changed during M7.1.

## M8 — Pluggable Observation Backends & eBPF Evidence Path

**CLOSED / ACCEPTED AS RESEARCH PROGRAM — PUBLIC eBPF EXPOSURE DEFERRED**

M8 built and adversarially evaluated an eBPF observation path without replacing or weakening the native ptrace correctness reference.

Gate status:

1. **M8.0 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED:** backend contract, capability/completeness/loss/privacy/comparability architecture.
2. **M8.1 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED:** ptrace moved behind a backend abstraction while existing CI/distribution/action behavior remained stable.
3. **M8.2 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED:** Aya and libbpf-rs passed feasibility hard gates; **libbpf-rs / libbpf selected for the experimental implementation**. Apache-2.0 and packaging constraints remain explicit.
4. **M8.3 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED:** typed partial-capability contract, conditional fail-closed path resolution, isolated libbpf observer, launched-tree scoping, explicit loss/limit handling and observation-only CLI bridge proved. Default `observe`, `learn`, and `check` retained ptrace semantics.
5. **M8.4 — CLOSED / PROVED:** producer loss, truncation, consumer lag, post-root descendant drain, lifecycle timeout, machine-readable collector/decode failures and post-start containment were proved fail-closed.
6. **M8.5 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED:** bounded cross-backend parity was proved for selected process/exec and focused successful-open propositions, including counterexamples and fail-closed incomplete-state handling. Full-surface equivalence was not established.
7. **M8.6 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED — MEASUREMENT GATE:** exact-host work showed per-invocation libbpf teardown dominated measured lifecycle cost and motivated persistent attachment rather than timing shortcuts.
8. **M8.7 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED — BOUNDED PERSISTENT SESSION ARCHITECTURE FEASIBLE:** persistent attachment, session epochs, root-registration barrier, task-creation propagation, descendant drain, reset checks, crash/restart isolation, routing failure, producer loss, event-budget exhaustion and live stale-epoch rejection were proved for the tested single-active-session architecture. M8.7c reduced the conservative two-session amortized libbpf cost by about 16.7% on the exact host, but remained about 50.5x the ptrace median.
9. **M8.8 — CLOSED / DEFER:** public eBPF exposure was not justified by evidence available at M8 closure. The research asset was retained with explicit reopen conditions.

## M9 — Independent Adoption & Real-Workload Evidence

**CLOSED — M9.0 CLOSED / PROVED; M9.1 CLOSED; M9.2 CLOSED / KILLED IN DECLARED SEARCH SCOPE; M9.3 CLOSED / PRODUCT DECISION FROZEN**

M9 evaluated the existing public product using real external workloads while keeping compatibility evidence, independent adoption, performance evidence and backend authority distinct.

### M9.0 — Protocol & Intake Freeze

**CLOSED / PROVED**

The canonical evidence schema, independence classes, privacy/failure-preservation rules, 3+15 performance protocol and predeclared M6.5 trigger were frozen before accepted M9 evidence.

Protocol: `docs/milestones/M9_PROTOCOL.md`.
Schema: `docs/milestones/M9_EVIDENCE_SCHEMA.json`.

### M9.1 — Zero-Contact External Workload Expansion

**CLOSED — EXTERNAL COMPATIBILITY/PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE, NOT ADOPTION**

Pinned unmodified external workloads were exercised under `ZERO_CONTACT_EXTERNAL_REPRO`. Accepted runtime-oriented cases produced repeated unchanged PASS results and controlled-drift REVIEW results while preserved negative evidence exposed process-lifecycle and build/test-variance friction.

The ptrace lifecycle blocker was hardened without blanket ESRCH ignoring, sleeps, threshold weakening or semantic relaxation. Later real-workload performance evidence crossed the predeclared trigger and therefore permitted a bounded same-workload eBPF value screen.

That eBPF value screen did **not** establish a value claim: the current per-invocation libbpf path failed completeness/health gates (`incomplete_lifecycle` and, on one warmup, `incomplete_capability`) before accepted measured samples could begin. Result: **KILLED FOR VALUE CLAIM / PARTIAL_NO_VALUE_CLAIM**. Ptrace remains the public correctness reference; eBPF remains research-only.

Closeout/evidence includes `docs/milestones/M9_1_EBPF_TRIGGER_VALUE_SCREEN_RESULT.md` and the preserved M9.1 evidence tree.

### M9.2 — Independent Adoption Evidence

**CLOSED / KILLED — NO ACCEPTED INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE IN DECLARED SEARCH SCOPE (2026-09-27)**

M9.2 froze provenance, intake, countability and close-gate rules before discovery. Positive closure required at least two countable `INDEPENDENT_USER` records from two distinct external repositories/references, with successful install/doctor/baseline/unchanged checks and at least one comparable complete drift case.

The preregistered S1–S7 public GitHub discovery scope was then executed. It found registry/distribution metadata and unrelated `ExecSurface`/`execSurfaces` name collisions, but **0 accepted independent adoption records**, **0 countable positive-close records**, and **0 accepted independent drift records**.

This is a bounded negative result for the declared public GitHub scope only. It does not claim that no private, local, unindexed, off-GitHub or otherwise undiscovered use exists.

Gate: `docs/milestones/M9_2_INDEPENDENT_ADOPTION_GATE.md`.
Protocol: `docs/milestones/M9_2_INDEPENDENT_ADOPTION_PROTOCOL.md`.
Discovery scope: `docs/milestones/M9_2_DISCOVERY_SCOPE.md`.
Discovery ledger: `docs/milestones/M9_2_DISCOVERY_LEDGER.md`.
Closeout: `docs/milestones/M9_2_CLOSEOUT.md`.

Post-M9.2 external-evaluation outreach is prospective only. It does not reopen or rewrite the frozen M9.2 result; any future qualifying third-party run is new evidence and must be classified prospectively under the existing provenance/privacy rules.

### M9.3 — Evidence Synthesis / Product Decision

**CLOSED — CONTINUE PUBLIC ALPHA UNDER BOUNDED CLAIMS**

M9.3 synthesized the accepted M9.1 compatibility/performance/drift evidence, preserved failure/friction evidence, the negative eBPF value-screen result, and the bounded M9.2 adoption result.

Product decision:

- keep `v0.1.0-alpha.3` as the current public alpha;
- keep native ptrace as the public correctness-reference backend;
- keep eBPF research-only with no PASS, `learn`/`check`, auto-selection, public-integration, or baseline-interchange authority;
- make no independent-adoption claim from the frozen M9.2 scope;
- make no universal performance claim from exact-host M9.1 measurements;
- make no runtime-semantics, evidence-authority, policy-threshold, verdict, or privacy-boundary change merely to improve product narrative;
- prioritize prospective independent evidence, semantics-preserving ptrace cost reduction, explicit research into legitimate ephemeral build/test behavior, and eBPF completeness research before any future value claim.

M9.3 does not justify promoting maturity beyond public alpha or cutting a new binary release solely for milestone closure.

Decision: `docs/milestones/M9_3_EVIDENCE_SYNTHESIS_PRODUCT_DECISION.md`.
Tracking: issue #83.
