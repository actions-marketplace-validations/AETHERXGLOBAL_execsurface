## Decision

`P8_A3_INTEROPERABILITY_GAP_REPRODUCED_BOUNDED — G2_MAPPING_COMPLETE`

The external finding is real in the tested Alpha.5 raw-observation scope.

No product/schema change is authorized by this result.

## G1 — Exact Alpha.5 reproduction

GitHub-hosted Ubuntu 24.04 reproduced the finding against the immutable published Alpha.5 artifact.

Observed bounded result:

- raw schema version: `2`;
- backend: `linux-ptrace-metadata-v2`;
- target command completed successfully;
- one target `file_descriptor_access/write` event was retained;
- retained write-event keys were exactly:
  `event_type, fd, operation, path, sequence, tid`;
- no transferred-byte / syscall-result field was carried in the event;
- observation health was exposed through global `complete=true` and `warnings=[]`;
- no typed collection-health envelope was present.

Accepted result:

`P8_A3_G1_GAP_REPRODUCED_BOUNDED`

## G2 — Mapping to existing Semantics v3 research model

### 1. Typed collection health

External need:
a consumer needs to distinguish typed observation-health/completeness properties rather than treat one global Boolean as all semantic authority.

Current public Alpha.5:
- global `complete`;
- warning list;
- backend capabilities/limitations.

Research-only Semantics v3 already contains:
- `CompletenessDimension`;
- `CompletenessState::{Complete, Incomplete, Ambiguous, Unsupported, NotRequired}`;
- `ObserverHealthObserved`;
- fail-closed proof requirements over required completeness dimensions.

Classification:

`REPRESENTED_IN_RESEARCH_V3 — NOT EXPOSED_BY_PUBLIC_ALPHA5`

This is external evidence that the existing research direction addresses a real interoperability need. It is not evidence that the prototype is ready for promotion.

### 2. Successful file-write result semantics

External need:
the consumer must know that the retained fd-write event represents a successful positive-byte I/O rather than merely a pre-operation attempt.

Current public Alpha.5:
- the native backend emits fd read/write attribution only for successful positive-byte I/O;
- that result semantics is not explicit in the retained event fields themselves.

Research-only Semantics v3 already contains:
- `Proposition::FileFdEffectObserved`;
- `ObservationPoint::SyscallResultPostOperation`;
- `TemporalBinding::SuccessfulOperationResult`;
- `IdentityBasis::RuntimeFdPathCorrelated`;
- proposition-scoped proof guarantees.

Classification:

`SUCCESS_SEMANTICS_REPRESENTED_IN_RESEARCH_V3 — NUMERIC_BYTE_COUNT_NOT_REPRESENTED`

The external integration needed a nine-byte state statement for its own state-binding protocol. ExecSurface does **not** need to expose content bytes or a numeric byte count merely to communicate that the observed fd effect followed a successful positive-byte syscall result.

### 3. Before/after bytes and state roots

The Probity companion captures explicit before/after fixture bytes and derives a state root.

ExecSurface's accepted metadata-only privacy contract explicitly avoids file-content collection.

Classification:

`INTENTIONALLY_OUT_OF_CORE_SCOPE`

Do not solve this finding by adding default file-content capture, filesystem state roots, or Merkle-state semantics to ExecSurface.

### 4. Signature, commitment, custody and trusted time

The external companion creates same-operator Ed25519 commitments and explicitly states that they do not establish independent custody or trusted time.

ExecSurface P5 research already keeps cryptographic validity, provenance identity, semantic authority and observer completeness distinct.

Classification:

`OUTSIDE_THIS_PRODUCT_GATE / COMPOSITION_LAYER_CONCERN`

No general custody/signing subsystem is authorized in ExecSurface by this finding.

### 5. Causal source-code provenance

The Alpha.5 backend explicitly states that runtime fd-path evidence is not causal source-code provenance.

Classification:

`EXPLICITLY_NOT_CLAIMED`

No expansion is authorized.

## G2 design conclusion

The evidence currently favors testing a **report/evidence-layer typed bridge** rather than changing the raw schema immediately.

Candidate only:

`REPORT_LAYER_TYPED_HEALTH_BRIDGE`

The candidate would aim to expose proposition-scoped guarantees such as `successful_operation_result` plus typed health/completeness derived under explicit proof rules, while preserving:

- raw schema-v2 evidence unchanged for Alpha.5 compatibility;
- metadata-only privacy;
- baseline/policy separation;
- fail-closed incompleteness;
- no content capture;
- no general state/custody system.

## Not authorized yet

The candidate remains unapproved until G3 adversarial tests show that raw-v2 facts can be mapped into typed guarantees without authority inflation or completeness laundering.

Next gate: **G3 failure-first adversarial mapping matrix**.\n\nG3 implementation is tracked in PR #147 and the dedicated `p8_a3_typed_bridge_redteam` test target.


## G3 — Failure-first typed-bridge red team

Accepted source before closeout:
`baf2e8803ec40e2eafdee9341521010924f7291b`

Accepted run:
`37195863962`

Static gates:
- `cargo fmt --check`: PASS
- Clippy `-D warnings`: PASS

Adversarial corpus:
**13/13 PASS**

The matrix retained and passed attacks covering:

1. positive control with bounded successful-write semantics only;
2. failed/zero-byte write with no fd-effect cannot be promoted;
3. short positive write cannot become an exact byte-count claim;
4. repeated writes are not collapsed into one effect;
5. warning + successful target exit remains non-promotable;
6. truncation/incomplete observation fails closed;
7. path substitution fails the bound proof requirement;
8. process/TID binding mismatch is rejected;
9. shared-FD ambiguity cannot be laundered into complete health;
10. binary/source identity mismatch is rejected;
11. backend naming cannot upgrade evidence authority;
12. external before/after snapshots cannot strengthen the bridge output;
13. a warning cannot be ignored even if a synthetic input leaves `complete=true`.

### Retained negative harness evidence

Two earlier attempts failed **before the scientific corpus ran**:

- run `37195753954`: formatting-only failure;
- run `37195788264`: escaped-newline harness defect exposed by format parsing.

No test assertion, authority rule, completeness requirement, threshold, or semantic expectation was weakened to obtain the accepted result.

Decision:

`P8_A3_G3_TYPED_BRIDGE_REDTEAM_PASS_BOUNDED`

## G4 — Architecture decision

The preregistered outcome is:

`REPORT_LAYER_TYPED_HEALTH_BRIDGE`

This is selected over the alternatives for the tested scope.

### Why not `RAW_SCHEMA_NEXT_CANDIDATE`

The external need can be satisfied without changing the immutable Alpha.5 raw-v2 evidence contract. Numeric write byte counts and file contents are not required to express the bounded semantic fact that a retained fd-write event followed successful positive-byte I/O.

### Why not `SEMANTICS_V3_PUBLIC_PROMOTION_CANDIDATE`

The research v3 model is useful and directly relevant, but the external finding does not justify promoting the whole v3 research surface into the public product. Only a narrow typed report/evidence projection is justified by current evidence.

### Why not `NO_PRODUCT_CHANGE_EXTERNAL_ADAPTER_SUFFICIENT`

Probity's external companion proves that an adapter is possible, but it also demonstrates avoidable duplication: a consumer must reconstruct health and successful-effect semantics that ExecSurface already knows internally. A narrow first-party report bridge is therefore materially useful.

### Selected boundary

The candidate bridge may expose only facts already justified by the producer's bounded observer semantics, such as:

- producer/backend semantic profile;
- typed collection health/completeness;
- proposition-scoped successful-operation guarantee;
- runtime-fd path-correlation identity basis;
- explicit ambiguity/unsupported states;
- stable limitation codes.

It must not add:

- file contents;
- before/after state roots;
- custody;
- trusted time;
- signatures as behavioral authority;
- causal source-code provenance;
- exact transferred byte counts unless separately observed and justified;
- automatic public-v3 baseline migration.

Decision:

`P8_A3_G4_REPORT_LAYER_TYPED_HEALTH_BRIDGE_SELECTED_BOUNDED`

## G5 — Compatibility / anti-drift

Accepted checks on the same research change set:

- full CI run `37195864075`: **SUCCESS**
- P9.3 Compatibility Contract run `37195863982`: **SUCCESS**
- immutable Alpha.5 gap reproduction run `37195863981`: **SUCCESS**
- G3 typed-bridge red-team run `37195863962`: **SUCCESS**

The research-only bridge test does not change:

- raw observation schema v2;
- baseline schema/digest semantics;
- policy schema or matcher meanings;
- PASS/ERROR/REVIEW/BLOCK exit meanings;
- current GitHub Action contract;
- public Linux x86_64 + native ptrace support boundary;
- Alpha.5 metadata-only privacy contract.

Decision:

`P8_A3_G5_COMPATIBILITY_ANTI_DRIFT_PASS_BOUNDED`

## Final gate decision

`P8_A3_INTEROPERABILITY_GAP_REPRODUCED_AND_BOUNDED_PATH_SELECTED`

The external finding is accepted and reproduced. The selected response is a narrow **report-layer typed-health/evidence bridge**, not a raw-schema rewrite and not full Semantics v3 promotion.

This closes the research decision gate only. It does **not** constitute:

- product integration approval;
- vNext release approval;
- P8 A5 closeout;
- A1 zero-assistance reproduction;
- A4 external real-workload evidence;
- production adoption.

A separate implementation gate must build and attack a minimal research-only bridge before any public API or release decision.
